# bricks-breaking-
A classic brick-breaking game built with Java, featuring paddle and ball mechanics, real-time collision detection, and a scoring system. Players use a paddle to keep the ball in play and break bricks for points. This project demonstrates skills in game mechanics, GUI development with Swing, and interactive logic-building.
